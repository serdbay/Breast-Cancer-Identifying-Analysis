# Breast Cancer Classification
In this project we will be analyzing Breast Cancer Data. This dataset is a comprehensive dataset that contains nearly all the PLCO study data available for breast cancer incidence and mortality analyses.

## General Information
Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The key challenges against it’s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous). We will try to complete the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning and the Breast Cancer Dataset.

## Setup
Before starting off this project you need to be familiar with machine learning especially with classification algorithms. Plus, you need to download our "breast-cancer.csv" file provided in the project.

## Usage
In this project we will try to understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required). Then we will build classification models to predict whether the cancer type is Malignant or Benign.

Then we will also fine-tune the hyperparameters and compare the evaluation metrics of our model.
